Dev SetUp:

Install NodeJS
https://nodejs.org/en/

If you are in Windows, you can use the msi installers in this link for the easiest way to set up NodeJS.
If you have NodeJS already installed, check that you have the latest version by using node -v. It should return the current LTS version.
If you are using a Mac, we recommend that you use homebrew to install and manage NodeJS.
 Note

The current supported LTS version of NodeJS for the SharePoint Framework is both 8.x and 10.x. Notice that 9.x or 11.x versions are currently not supported with SharePoint Framework development.

Install a code editor
You can use any code editor or IDE that supports client-side development to build your web part, such as:

Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Install Yeoman and gulp
Yeoman helps you kick-start new projects, and prescribes best practices and tools to help you stay productive. SharePoint client-side development tools include a Yeoman generator for creating new web parts. The generator provides common build tools, common boilerplate code, and a common playground website to host web parts for testing.

Enter the following command to install Yeoman and gulp:


npm install -g yo gulp
Install Yeoman SharePoint generator
The Yeoman SharePoint web part generator helps you quickly create a SharePoint client-side solution project with the right toolchain and project structure.

To install the SharePoint Framework Yeoman generator globally, enter the following command:


npm install -g @microsoft/generator-sharepoint
